## Monokai Space Gray

Based on the original Monokai color scheme by Wimer Hazenberg and from Sublime Text. This is a revamped and redesigned
version of the theme with seamless design.

Main purpose of the design is to create a uniform and minimalist approach to the development environment including
consistent coloring across user interfaces.
